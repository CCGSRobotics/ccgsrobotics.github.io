## Welcome to the CCGS Robotics Club

The robotics club is a group of keen student engineers and programmers who work to make robots to send to the annual international RoboCup Competition.

There are many elements to the creation of robots, namely:

Software Design
Networking
Algorithms (Pathfinding and Automation)
Electronics (Wiring Harness)
CAD/CAM Design using CATIA
Once we have robots we drive them on the terrain outside of TG11 in the D&T Department to prepare for the competition, where we complete a series of challenges to earn points.
